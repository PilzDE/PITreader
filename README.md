## PILZ PITreader Devices

PILZ [PITreader](https://www.pilz.com/en-INT/products/operating-and-monitoring/control-and-signal-devices/pitmode-operating-mode-selector-switch) devices are RFID based authentication systems for implementation of industrial access management.

The devices implement three interfaces for integration into other systems:
- REST API (HTTPS)
- Modbus/TCP
- OPC UA Server (only "PITreader S" and "PIT gb RLLE" variants)

This repository contains libraries to connect to the device using the HTTPS REST API and example client applications.
